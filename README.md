# Securing_Satellite_Systems_with_SQL

SmartTrack is a SQL-driven satellite security analysis project focused on monitoring and securing satellite systems through data analysis. Using structured datasets imported into MySQL Workbench, the project simulates a space infrastructure that integrates telemetry data, RF signals, access logs, user profiles, satellite metadata, and anomaly reports to detect cybersecurity threats such as signal jamming, telemetry spoofing, and unauthorized access.

## Problem Statement

  1) Satellite systems face significant cybersecurity challenges, including signal interference, spoofing of telemetry data, and unauthorized access. 
  2) This project addresses these threats by applying SQL-based data modeling and analysis to identify and investigate anomalies and suspicious activities effectively.

## Tools & Technologies used

  1) MySQL Workbench for database management and querying
  2) SQL for data retrieval, aggregation, and anomaly detection
  3) ER diagrams for database design and schema visualization

## Scope of Analysis

  1) Analyzes telemetry data from satellites to detect unusual sensor readings or anomalies.
  2) Monitors RF signal patterns to identify potential jamming or unauthorized transmissions.
  3) Tracks user access logs to detect unauthorized or abnormal login attempts.
  4) Correlates satellite metadata with anomaly reports to prioritize threats.
  5) Ranks satellites by anomaly counts and severity for focused security efforts.
  6) Examines temporal patterns in data to highlight persistent or intermittent security issues.
  7) Provides actionable insights through SQL queries and views for real-time threat detection and auditing.

## Conclusion

The SmartTrack project successfully demonstrates the application of SQL for cybersecurity threat detection in satellite systems. It integrates diverse data sources into a relational database to enable real-time anomaly detection, user access auditing, and system security analysis. This project builds essential skills in data modeling, advanced SQL querying, and practical cybersecurity analysis for satellite networks.
